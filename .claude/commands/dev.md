# Start Development Environment

Start the full development environment using Docker Compose.

## Instructions

1. Run `make dev` to start both frontend and backend containers
2. Wait for containers to be ready
3. Report the access URLs:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - Backend API: http://localhost:8000
   - API Docs: http://localhost:8000/docs

If there are errors, check container logs with `make logs`.
